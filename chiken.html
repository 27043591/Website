                <h1>Butter Chicken</h1>
       

         <img src="images/chiken.cms" alt="Smiley face" align="left"> <h3>  This dish has its roots in Moti Mahal Daryaganj. It was developed by three Indians,
              Kundan Lal
              Jaggi, Kundan Lal Gujral and Thakur Dass all Punjabi Hindu restaurateur who were the founders of Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, India. The 
              dish was created by the three partners at their restaurant in Delhi in the 1950s. The dish was made "By Chance" by mixing the leftover chicken
              n a tomato gravy, rich in butter and cream.<p>
            Chicken is marinated for several hours in a lemon juice, dahi (yogurt) and a mixture of Kashmiri red chilli, salt, garam masala and ginger
             garlic
            paste. The chicken is usually cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but maybe grilled, roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild 
            curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato and onion based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has 
            evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is finally a velvety smooth. 
            Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala and fenugreek.</p><p> I can still, somewhat to my
                 dismay, remember the first time I tried butter chicken. Far from the delicious staple found in almost every Indian restaurant the
                  world over, the version that I sampled as a teenager came frozen in a box, and was prepared by microwave. As I write this I can imagine
                   you, the reader, shuddering at the thought – frozen, premade, and heated in the microwave? To say the least I was underwhelmed. I was 
                   also unprepared for just how savoury the real deal would be.

                    The dish, which is also called Murgh Makhani in Hindi, is without question the most popular dish to emerge from India; it may
                     even be one of the most popular dishes in the world. If you are just going to an Indian restaurant for the first time, your
                      friends will likely recommend it as a starting place. Its mildly spicy, creamy, savoury flavour makes it more than just delicious,
                       but accessible to almost every palate.
                    
                    Butter chicken originated in Delhi, the capital territory of India, sometime during the 1950s. During this time, a man named 
                    Kundan Lal Gurjal operated a restaurant in the city, called Moti Mahal. Kundan had settled here and started his business after
                     fleeing from political upheaval in another region of India. Moti Mahal was a success, serving many delightful tandoori dishes 
                     (a tandoor is a circular clay oven, and can be found in any Indian restaurant worth its salt).<p>
                    
                    So the story goes, the cooks of Moti Mahal would mix leftover marinade juices with butter and tomato, and then stew the
                     tandoor-cooked chicken in it. It’s unlikely that they had even the faintest idea of what they had stumbled upon – that is, 
                     an internationally-loved delicacy. But it is an irrefutable truth of the world that often the best things in life are
                      discovered quite by accident.
                    
                    Kundan’s restaurant quickly became a famous attraction of Delhi, and it wasn’t long before butter chicken proliferated
                     throughout the world, to be enjoyed by people from every walk of life.
                    
                    What gives the dish its distinctive flavour is its unique blend of spices, perfected over time. Typically, an Indian
                     restaurant will marinate the chicken for hours in yogurt blended with spices like garlic, coriander, garam marsala,
                      ginger, cumin, and others – it may vary from place to place. Then it’s cooked (typically tandoori-style) and simmered
                       in a mild curry sauce rich with butter, and in some cases, almonds and raisins as well.
                    
                    The result? A dish that has to be tasted to be believed, and one that’s a far cry from the disappointment I once
                     found in the frozen food section over a decade ago. If you’re wondering exactly what it takes to make a worldwide
                      sensation, one taste of butter chicken, the way it’s prepared in a quality Indian restaurant, will make you wonder no longer.
                       don’t take my word for it – after all, tasting is believing!</p></h3>
