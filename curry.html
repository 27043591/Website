                <h1>Pakoda Curry</h1>
        </div>
        <img src="images/pkoda curry.jpg" alt="Smiley face" align="left"><h3><p>In Northern India, pakoras are added to the gram flour gravy and sour 
            yogurt is added to add flavour to it. They are eaten either with boiled rice or roti. In Rajasthan and Gujarat, it is usually served
             with khichdi, roti, paratha or rice. It is considered a light food. Rajasthani and Gujarati kadhi differs from the Uttar Pradesh 
             variety. Traditionally, it is sweeter than the other variants, because sugar or jaggery is added to it, but it can be made without 
             sugar for a more sour taste. It is eaten without pakoras and its consistency is slightly thinner. The Gujarati kadhi is made 
             preferably from buttermilk as it gives a more smooth texture compared to yogurt. Variations on this basic dish includes the addition 
             of certain vegetables, notably bhindi (okra) in which case it is known as bhinda ni kadhi. In Punjab, kadhi is a simple, quick winter
              meal. Made from besan (also known as gram flour) to thicken the consistency, and adding pakoras, it is eaten with either long-grain
               basmati rice or, more commonly, with a roti. Unlike the rest of India, sour yoghurt is not added—just full-fat buttermilk or
                unsweetened yoghurt.

                In Haryana, a popular variation is called haryanvi hara choley kadhi, made with besan and hare choley (raw green chickpeas) with 
                pure ghee; the generous semi-melting dollops of homemade fresh butter are added during serving. Haryanvi kadhi is sometimes cooked
                 with additional ingredients, such as seasonal farm-fresh green bathua leaves or kachri, small wild melons.<p>
                
                In Southern states, it is seasoned with sauteed asafoetida, mustard seeds, cumin, and fenugreek. The soup is thickened in a
                 different way by addition of pureed split chickpea soaked overnight with whole coriander seeds and dry red chili pepper. 
                 Squash, okra, tomato, Chinese spinach, carrots, sweet peas are a few vegetables that are added to seasoning before bringing the 
                 soup to a boil. Pakoras (gram flour fritters) are added for special occasions like ceremonies. It is called majjige huli in 
                 Kannada, majjiga pulusu in Telugu and mor kuzhambu in Tamil with a similar meaning. In Kerala, it is called kaalan.
                
                The Sindhi diaspora in India usually make kadhi by first roasting the chickpea flour and adding vegetables to the chickpea gravy. 
                It is called kadhi because of the use of curry leaves, which are called kadhi patta in Sindhi. Instead of yogurt, tamarind pulp 
                is used to give it a sour taste. An alternate way is to make a liquid mixture of the chickpea flour instead of roasting chickpeas.
                
                Sindhi kadhi is made with a variation using tamarind pulp, ginger, turmeric powder, tomatoes, carrots, potato, ladyfingers 
                and coriander.[1] It is serve with a sweet boondi and rice</p></h3>
