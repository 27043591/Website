                Mixed Vegetables is about the relationship between the daughter of a pastry chef who wants to become a sushi chef and the son 
                of sushi chef who wants to become a pâtissier.The plot revolves around Hanayu Ashitaba, a chef in training. Hanayu is the daughter 
                of the celebrated pastry shop, Patisserie Ashitaba, but all she wants to do is become a sushi chef. Hayato Hyuga is the son of the 
                prestigious Sushi Hyuga, but he wants to be a pastry chef. They go to Oiwaka High School together. Hanayu knows she will break her 
                parent's heart if she does not continue the bakery and become a pastry chef, but thinks if she marries Hayato, they will 
                understand her
                 decision.</p><p>Frozen vegetables are vegetables that have had their temperature reduced and maintained to below their freezing
                      point for the purpose of storage and transportation (often for far longer than their natural shelf life would permit) until
                       they are ready to be eaten. They may be commercially packaged or frozen at home. A wide range of frozen vegetables are sold
                        in supermarkets.

                        Examples of frozen vegetables which can be found in supermarkets include spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, peas, corn, yam 
                        (in Asia) either packaged as a single ingredient or as mixtures. There are occasions when frozen vegetables are mixed with
                         other food types, such as pasta or cheese.
                        
                        Some popular brands include Birds Eye, Sunbulah and Green Giant, as well as supermarkets' 'store brand' items.
                        
                        Frozen vegetables have some advantages over fresh ones, in that they are available when the fresh counterpart is
                         out-of-season, they have a very long shelf life when kept in a freezer and that they often have been processed a step or
                          more closer to eating. In many cases, they may be more economical to purchase than their fresh counterparts.
                        
                        The history of frozen fruits can date back to the Liao Dynasty of China, with the "frozen" pear being a classic delicacy 
                        eaten by the Khitan tribes in the Northeastern region of China</p><p>The rich hue, strong aroma and irresistible taste of this Mixed Vegetable Sabzi will make you addicted to it!
