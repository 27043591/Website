             creamy and sumptuous delight. The vegetarians on the other hand, echo similar sentiments about Dal Makkhani. Now for those who are a
              fan of both the delicacies, we'll make the job easier for you. Did you know that both the dishes were the brainchild of a single 
              man, who came up with the lip-smacking recipe(s) in a bid to make his ingredients last longer.It is said that Kundan Lal Gujral,
               founder of Moti Mahal chain of restaurants, revolutionized the traditional preparation of black urad lentil. Kundan Lal Gujaral
                was working in Mukhey da Dhaba run by Mokha Singh in Peshawar around the '40s. There came a time when Mokha Singh's health
                 deteriorated and he eventually had to sell the shop to Gujral who renamed it as Moti Mahal. Post partition, Gujaral migrated to 
                 Delhi and carried on the legacy to establish Moti Mahal as the food institution we know today.<p>

                Black whole urad dal (black gram) served with hot rotis was a specialty of West Pakistan, which Gujaral brought along with him as 
                he crossed the national frontiers and included it in his dhaba menu. However, the turning point for the traditional black urad dal
                 preparation came about when Gujaral mixed cream and tomatoes (as a souring agent) to the dal. No Punjabi had ever done this
                  before. Even if they did require a souring agent, yogurt was used.<p>

                        The invention of Dal Makhni is closely linked with the invention of Butter Chicken. To save the chicken hanging on the 
                        seekhs above the tandoor all day from drying out, he came up with the brilliant idea of simmering the chicken in a 
                        luscious gravy with tomatoes, butter, cream and some spices to help them retain moisture. He applied the same recipe with
                         his black urad dal, and gave birth to Dal Makhani too around the same time.Nowadays, you find Dal Makhani as a staple in 
                         all North Indian restaurants across the country. You can too cook the buttery delicacy at home with this recipe
