<h2>How do I make a booking?</h2>
<p>It's a piece of cake - once you've found your preferred restaurant simply select
     your time and date and then so long as we have an email address and phone
      number your booking is instantly confirmed the minute you hit "Book Now". </p>
<h2>How can I be certain my booking's been received?</h2>
<p>We'll send an instant confirmation email to the address used in your booking. 
    If you book more than a day ahead, we'll also send a reminder 24 hours before
     your booking is due. You can reconfirm your booking using a link in your 
     reminder email.</p>
<h2>What happens if I don't reconfirm my booking?</h2>
<p>Don't worry, your restaurant will still hold your booking without a reconfirmation.</p>
<h2>I'm sure I've booked, but I haven't had confirmation - what now?</h2>
<p>We will always send you an automated confirmation when your booking is confirmed 
    at the restaurant. If you haven't received a confirmation, please start the
     process again. If you continue to have an issue please give us a call on 09
      928 6079 during business hours or drop us a line at info@restauranthub.co.nz
       and we'll be in touch to resolve the issue.</p>
       <h2>What happens if I'm running late?</h2>
       <p>Call the restaurant. Every restaurant is different, but most will hold a 
           booking for at least twenty minutes before reassigning your table. </p>
           <h2>What happens if I get to the restaurant and they don't have my booking?</h2>
<p>TAj restaurants are committed to honour any confirmed bookings we
     have generated. For added peace of mind you should always reconfirm your
      booking using the the link included in your reminder email, and it's also
       a good idea to take your confirmation email with you.</p>
<h2>How do I cancel a booking?</h2>
<p>To help our restaurants manage their sittings we ask our diners to give at least
     24 hours' notice of 
    any cancellations. You can do this by calling your restaurant direct. If you need to cancel less than 24 hours before your dinner date you
         can use the cancellation link within your reminder email (sent 24 hours
          before your reservation time). We also encourage our diners to follow this
          with a call direct to the restaurant.
        
        To amend a booking please call the restaurant direct, again endeavouring
         to give at least 24 hours' notice.</p>
<h2>How much do I have to pay for my booking?</h2>
<p>Absolutely nothing! All bookings made through Restaurant Hub are free to the consumer.</p>
<h2>How can I purchase a Deal?</h2>
<p>Taj Restaurant Platinums are transacted using NZME (GrabOne) transactional 
    technology. Clicking on any Platinum promotion links on Restaurant Hub will
     allow you to purchase - you will be transferred to GrabOne's shopping cart to
      buy the Platinum promotion.  
 Once you've bought a promotion you can also instantly reserve your table. We'll 
 attach your deal to your booking details, but you'll still need to present your
  deal purchase to the restaurant. This can be done by mobile phone, for added 
  security we always recommend taking a paper voucher with you too.  </p>
<h2>What happens if I get to the restaurant and they won't honour my deal?</h2>
<p>Taj restaurants are committed to honour promotions sold as part of any Restaurant Hub booking. It's a good idea to take a copy of
     your booking confirmation with you, just in case there is an issue. You should also take a copy of your promotion purchase with you.   </p>
<h2>I can see my favourite restaurant on the site - but I can't book with them. What can I do?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately some restaurants don't take bookings or haven't yet shifted to a digital booking system. Where possible we still list these
     restaurants onsite - we want Restaurant Hub to list as many of your favourite restaurants as possible. If you still can't find your favourite 
     haunt please email us on info@restauranthub.co.nz and we promise to tell the restaurant customers like you need them to get with the program...! </p>
