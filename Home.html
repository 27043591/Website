  <h1>About Us</h1>

<h2>Taj Restaurant serves authentic Hyderabadi Mughlai cuisine that dates back to some 500 years to the Mughal empire in India. 
    Hyderabad, the world-famous South Indian city, is renowned for its tasty food and rich culture. Hyderabadi food claims to 
    retain the authenticity of Mughlai cuisine in their dishes.<p>

    Mughlai Cuisine was influenced by Persian and Turkish cultures as a result of which a lot of Persian terms are used in
     naming of dishes. Some of the famous Mughlai dishes that we serve at Bawarchi are: Kebabs, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Chicken,
      Chicken 65, Chicken Manchuria, Chilli Chicken, Pepper Chicken, Lamb Khorma, Charcoal Chicken , Butter Chicken, Chicken
       Masala and many more.<p>
    
    We are conscious of vegetarian dietary requirements and have many vegetarian dishes on the menu. Our customers love our
     Paneer Kofta(cottage cheese), Bagare Baigan(Eggplant), Palak Paneer (Spinach with cottage cheese), Daal (Lentils) and Egg
      Curry.
    
    At the heart of Mughlai cuisine lies a very special dish known as Hyderabadi Biryani. Over time a lot of different variants 
    of Biryani have evolved in different parts of India and beyond but, none of the variants retain the flavour of traditionally
     ground spices and the aroma of Hyderabadi Biryani. At Bawarchi we ensure that our expert chefs use the best available 
     ingredients to make a mouth-watering taste bud tingling Hyderabadi Biryani that our customers love. We are so passionate 
     about our Hyderabadi Biryani that we offer it in different varieties; Mutton Biryani, Chicken Biryani, Vegetable Biryani & 
     Seafood Biryani (Pre-Order only*) to match your dietary needs. Our Biryani takeaway family packs come with raita, mirchi ka 
     salan and a dessert.
     If rice is not your thing then you can always try our fresh tandoor (clay oven) baked Plain, Butter or Garlic Naans to 
    go with your Mughlai curry dish.<p>
    
    A Mughlai meal is incomplete without a traditional Mughlai dessert and we offer you lip-smacking options to choose
     from â€“ Gajar ka meetha (A traditional dessert made with carrots), Double ka Meetha (A Hyderabadi speciality made with fried
      bread), Kheer (Must have for people who adore milky desserts) & Gulab Jamun (A unique Indian dumpling dessert).<p>
    
    The grand finale would be a traditional Indian yoghurt drink popularly known as Lassi! (We serve Mango, Sweet and
     Spiced Lassi)</h2>
